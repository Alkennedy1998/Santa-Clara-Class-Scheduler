## Idea by: Matthew Zhang

A node application created to generate all possibly schedules given the classes a student wants. Will provide real-time suggestions as sections run out of seats.


Run app.js with "node app.js" and change the string passed to get_data to see different class results

## Don't have the node_modules folder or all of the modules?
Run `npm install` when you clone the repository.
